  abstract = {Histone modifications are implicated in influencing gene expression.
	We have generated high-resolution maps for the genome-wide distribution
	of 20 histone lysine and arginine methylations as well as histone
	variant H2A.Z, RNA polymerase II, and the insulator binding protein
	CTCF across the human genome using the Solexa 1G sequencing technology.
	Typical patterns of histone methylations exhibited at promoters,
	insulators, enhancers, and transcribed regions are identified. The
	monomethylations of H3K27, H3K9, H4K20, H3K79, and H2BK5 are all
	linked to gene activation, whereas trimethylations of H3K27, H3K9,
	and H3K79 are linked to repression. H2A.Z associates with functional
	regulatory elements, and CTCF marks boundaries of histone methylation
	domains. Chromosome banding patterns are correlated with unique patterns
	of histone modifications. Chromosome breakpoints detected in T cell
	cancers frequently reside in chromatin regions associated with H3K4
	methylations. Our data provide new insights into the function of
	histone methylation and chromatin organization in genome function.},

  abstract = {Mammalian promoters can be separated into two classes, conserved TATA
	box-enriched promoters, which initiate at a well-defined site, and
	more plastic, broad and evolvable CpG-rich promoters. We have sequenced
	tags corresponding to several hundred thousand transcription start
	sites (TSSs) in the mouse and human genomes, allowing precise analysis
	of the sequence architecture and evolution of distinct promoter classes.
	Different tissues and families of genes differentially use distinct
	types of promoters. Our tagging methods allow quantitative analysis
	of promoter usage in different tissues and show that differentially
	regulated alternative TSSs are a common feature in protein-coding
	genes and commonly generate alternative N termini. Among the TSSs,
	we identified new start sites associated with the majority of exons
	and with 3' UTRs. These data permit genome-scale identification of
	tissue-specific promoters and analysis of the cis-acting elements

  abstract = {We report the application of single-molecule-based sequencing technology
	for high-throughput profiling of histone modifications in mammalian
	cells. By obtaining over four billion bases of sequence from chromatin
	immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state
	maps of mouse embryonic stem cells, neural progenitor cells and embryonic
	fibroblasts. We find that lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation effectively
	discriminates genes that are expressed, poised for expression, or
	stably repressed, and therefore reflect cell state and lineage potential.
	Lysine 36 trimethylation marks primary coding and non-coding transcripts,
	facilitating gene annotation. Trimethylation of lysine 9 and lysine
	20 is detected at satellite, telomeric and active long-terminal repeats,
	and can spread into proximal unique sequences. Lysine 4 and lysine
	9 trimethylation marks imprinting control regions. Finally, we show
	that chromatin state can be read in an allele-specific manner by
	using single nucleotide polymorphisms. This study provides a framework
	for the application of comprehensive chromatin profiling towards
	characterization of diverse mammalian cell populations.},

        how RNA polymerase II transcription is controlled. New experimental
        technologies have enabled genome-wide discovery and characterization
        of core promoters, revealing that most mammalian genes do not conform
        to the simple model in which a TATA box directs transcription from
        a single defined nucleotide position. In fact, most genes have multiple
        promoters, within which there are multiple start sites, and alternative
        promoter usage generates diversity and complexity in the mammalian
        transcriptome and proteome. Promoters can be described by their start
        site usage distribution, which is coupled to the occurrence of cis-regulatory
        elements, gene function and evolutionary constraints. A comprehensive

        and discerns when and where to initiate it. Locating transcription
        start sites (TSSs), the signals that specify them, and ultimately
        elucidating the mechanisms of regulated initiation has therefore
        been a recurrent theme. In recent years substantial progress has
        been made towards this goal, spurred by the possibility of applying
        genome-wide, sequencing-based analysis. We now have a large collection
        of high-resolution datasets identifying locations of TSSs, protein-DNA
        interactions, and chromatin features over whole genomes; the field
        is now faced with the daunting challenge of translating these descriptive
        maps into quantitative and predictive models describing the underlying
        biology. We review here the genomic and chromatin features that underlie
        TSS selection and usage, focusing on the differences between the
